#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Softwrae engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. It involves the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software products.
Software engineering plays a critical role in the  technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

The development of programming langauges;
The establishment of software engineering as a discipline on the 1960s;
The advent of structured programming in the 1970s and;
The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation: Writing code and building software according to the design specifications.
Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after customers. 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall is the sequential approach with distinct phases, such as the requirements, design and implementation, and it flows downwards like a waterfall. 
Agile methodologies follow an iterative and incremental approach which is focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Develoer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer ensure software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code. Visual Studio, Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA are examples of IDEs.
Version Control Systems are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members. Git and Subversion are examples of VCS.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Some challenges that are faced by software engineers are:
Changing requirements which may occur during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
Tight deadlines caused by the pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
Technical debt which is accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
Some strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software;
Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. Prompt engineering helps avoid asking vague questions by making your questions clear and specific, so the AI understands exactly what you need. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

A simple example is if you ask, "Tell me about cats," the AI might give you a general answer. Whereas if you ask, "Tell me about the history of domestic cats," you will get a more focused response.
